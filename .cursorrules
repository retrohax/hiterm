# General Coding Rules

The maintainer of this project prefers snake case for function and variable names.

# Arduino Project Rules - Always use these for shell/tool commands

You are working on an Arduino project in WSL Ubuntu.
When suggesting or running shell commands for compiling or uploading:

- ALWAYS use arduino-cli (never Arduino IDE commands or manual avrdude/esptool unless explicitly asked)
- ALWAYS compile with --export-binaries so binaries stay in the sketch folder
- Use this exact FQBN: esp32:esp32:esp32
- ALWAYS use port: /dev/ttyUSB0 for upload
- Preferred compile command: arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32:PartitionScheme=huge_app --export-binaries .
- Preferred full workflow: arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32:PartitionScheme=huge_app --export-binaries . && arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32
- Never suggest Windows COM ports or PowerShell syntax
- If the user asks to upload, prefer running the full compile+upload chain in one go
- Before any upload, remind to ensure usbipd is attached if needed
- Be concise with commands, show them in code blocks
